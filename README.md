# ABCNotationapp

Manage your personal inventory:
The ABCNotationapp is used to manage the personal belongings in your own household. It can create people / owners, categories of products (such as TV, computer, jewelry, etc.) or even manufacturers often used. Furthermore, these objects rooms such as the basement, the office or the garden can be assigned.

ABCNotationapp ships with a number of categories, brands, example owners, and rooms. When using for the first time, it is advisable to adapt the individual terms to the personal situation in the "Manage objects" area. Afterwards you can start to record the personal inventory. Photos of an item can also be added here (if the user allows camera use), or already created PDF files containing billing information.

After capturing, PDF-based reports can be generated and distributed or printed out.

The app is available as a universal app and can be used both on current iPhones (iOS at least 11.4).

The app includes a number of categories, brands, example owners, and rooms. When using for the first time, it is advisable to adapt the individual areas to the personal situation in the "Manage objects" area. Afterwards you can start to record the personal inventory. Photos of the item can also be added here (if the user allows camera use), or already created PDF files containing billing information.

Once the inventory has been captured, the Import / Export section allows exporting the captured data to a csv (comma separated value) file, which can then be imported into Numbers or Excel for further processing or to another iOS device to import.

Due to the amount of data (if a photo and a PDF is saved for each inventory object), it is not possible in the current version of the app to automatically match the data between several iOS devices of the user (via iCloud or similar). That is why all photos and PDF files in the export area are also exported along with the csv file so that a transfer to another device is possible.

If an iPhone backup is created using iTunes or iCloud, all data of the app will be saved.

In the Reports section it is then possible for the user to create a PDF report that can be forwarded by email, saved in the files area or even printed out. It is possible to apply different filters and sorting criteria here.

For more information about the app itself, you finally get in the "About Inventory" area where you can view the manual as a PDF as well as, for example, receives privacy notices.

Ultimately, the app allows a user to make all his personal belongings available at a glance, for example, to have a household insurance report in the event of burglary or water damage.

Outlook: Apple should actually allow it in the future, with little effort to run iOS apps on the Mac, I will consider this. There are already a number of ideas to further develop the app (for example, to enable biometric authentication). About the app itself, it is possible to send feedback.
